              <h3>Γειά σου!</h3>
              <h3>Hello!</h3>
              <p>My name is André, and I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. In this article, I'd like to introduce myself, share a bit of my background, and explain why I created this website.</p>
                        <figure>

                    <h3>A little about me</h3>

                    <p>I've always been a curious person. Since childhood, I've had a strong desire to understand how and why things exist,
                        how they work, and what's behind them. This curiosity applies to objects, people, and even the universe. I enjoy
                        learning a bit about everything—from turning plastic bags into gasoline, to human psychology, to the origins of
                        languages spoken by Paleolithic tribes.</p>

                    <h3>My education</h3>

                    <p>I hold a technical degree in Industrial Automation and Electronics from SENAI (Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem
                        Industrial), a Brazilian institution focused on industrial and technical education. You could compare it to a blend
                        of Community Colleges and Trade Schools in the U.S., or Further Education colleges in the U.K., depending on the
                        program type. SENAI offers free courses, technical diplomas, and even undergraduate degrees, all geared toward
                        industry.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>During the course, I learned about electricity, electronics, programming, and above all—my true passion: robotics. I
                        learned to program in C, C++, and even Assembly, as well as industry-specific languages like SCADA and Ladder Logic.
                        Working with PLCs helped broaden my understanding of programming logic. I also had the opportunity to develop
                        embedded systems using microcontrollers for machine control, monitoring, and robotics.</p>
                    <p>I studied pneumatic and hydraulic systems as well—fields that require close attention to detail, as mistakes can lead
                        to serious consequences. Another subject I loved was power electronics and energy systems. Gaining this knowledge
                        felt liberating because it opened doors beyond software—I could also work on energy distribution systems.</p>
                    <p>Besides robotics and technology, I've always had a deep interest in architecture and civil engineering. That led me
                        to pursue a Technical Degree in Building Construction from ETEC, a public technical school in São Paulo, between
                        2013 and 2015.</p>
                    <p>This program prepared me for various stages of construction projects—from planning and design to supervision and
                        quality control. Between 2017 and 2020, I completed a college-level program at FATEC (a public university of
                        technology), majoring in Highway Engineering Technology.</p>
                    <p>That course qualified me to support and supervise road construction, maintenance, and management. I learned to run
                        field and lab tests on soils, concrete, and asphalt, and implement productivity improvements in heavy machinery and
                        infrastructure projects. Around that time, I also took a course in automotive mechanics so I could repair my car
                        without relying too much on a mechanic.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at UNIVESP, a public virtual university in São
                        Paulo. I'm really enjoying it—it covers subjects I've always been passionate about. I started with foundational
                        topics like algorithms and computer programming, and moved into more advanced areas like Object-Oriented
                        Programming, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Algorithm Design and Analysis.</p>

                    </figure>
                    
                    <p>I'll soon be diving into topics like Hardware Design, Databases, Web and Mobile Development, Human-Computer
                        Interaction, Infrastructure, and Scalable Computing. I've also studied Embedded Systems, IoT Communication
                        Protocols, Data Ingestion and Analysis Platforms, Smart Cities, Automation, and Compilers.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My career journey</h3>

                    <p>My career path has been diverse, but my technical journey began around 2006. My background in automation allowed me
                        to work for major telecom companies, which I enjoyed because it exposed me to large-scale communication
                        networks—very different from the simplified versions taught in class.</p>
                    <p>Later, I broadened my experience with internships in small companies across energy, home automation, communications,
                        games (briefly), and even television—always doing electronics and automation-related work. These were short but
                        enriching experiences.</p>
                    <p>Around 2011–2012, the tech job market was struggling in Brazil, while construction was booming. Out of necessity, I
                        transitioned to civil construction. That's when I pursued the Technical Degree in Building Construction I mentioned
                        earlier. A construction technician supports engineers and architects with planning, project development, budgeting,
                        quality control, and team coordination. Based on my research, the closest equivalents abroad would be "Construction
                        Technician" or "Construction Manager Assistant" in the U.S., and "Site Technician" or "Building Technician" in the
                        U.K.</p>

                            <figcaption>Structural engineering is one of my greatest passions.</figcaption>
                    </figure>


                    <p>From there, I began working in the field. One of my jobs was at a structural engineering office using BIM tools. I
                        fell in love with structural calculations and simulations. It sparked an internal dilemma because I had just shifted
                        careers and already missed programming—but I kept going.</p>
                    <p>In 2014–2015, Brazil faced a major economic and political crisis, and construction jobs started disappearing. I left
                        the engineering firm and started working independently as a handyman—someone who does a bit of everything. I relied
                        on my construction knowledge to keep things going.</p>
                    <p>By 2017, I decided it was time to pursue a bachelor's degree in the construction field. I was torn between
                        Architecture and Civil Engineering, but chose the latter due to its better earning potential.</p>
                    <p>In 2020, the economy improved slightly, and I landed an internship at a major construction company. I acted as a site
                        supervisor, overseeing progress and budgets. It was an enriching experience, and I even developed an interest in
                        finance. Unfortunately, when the pandemic hit, I was let go due to my intern status.</p>
                    <p>Soon after, I joined a multinational engineering and consulting firm. I worked on lab reports for asphalt and
                        concrete tests for SABESP (the largest sanitation company in Latin America) and other clients. I learned a lot about
                        road engineering during this time.</p>
                    <p>Then in 2021, I received a completely different job offer—from one of Brazil's largest private universities. I was
                        invited to join the financial engineering department—an area I had never heard of before. It turned out to be the
                        most comfortable and engaging workplace I've experienced.</p>
                    <p>There, I continued supporting SABESP, but in a different department—analyzing, researching, and correcting the
                        pricing of materials used in public contracts. I learned a lot about pricing strategies and finally got to apply one
                        of my favorite subjects: statistics. With guidance from a team of economists, I learned how to build forecasts and
                        pricing models.</p>

                            <figcaption>FGV is highly respected for its economic studies, which influence public policies at the federal, state, and municipal levels.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Later on, we also began working on federal government projects, including employment trend studies. Our data was used
                        by city, state, and national agencies to guide public policy. It was deeply rewarding to know my work contributed to
                        something meaningful.</p>
                    <p>That was the beginning of my interest in data—something I hadn't appreciated fully until then. Working with massive
                        government datasets gave me the perfect opportunity to dive in. Few organizations work with databases of that size.
                        To better contribute, I decided to pursue a technology-related degree—returning to the field I had always loved.</p>
                    <p>So I enrolled in Computer Engineering—a degree I had long dreamed of. It was the right choice. However, due to public
                        university rules in Brazil, I had to leave my FATEC program because students can only be enrolled in one public
                        institution at a time. I do hope to return and finish it one day.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to my background in Computer Engineering, I landed an internship at one of the largest tech companies in Latin
                        America. I initially aimed to work in frontend or backend development, but my previous experience pointed me toward
                        data—and it was the right fit. I excelled in my role and received great feedback for my performance.</p>
                    <h3>Why I built this site</h3>
                    <p>I created this site mainly as a way to share my knowledge. I've accumulated a lot over the years and wanted an outlet
                        for it. As I began planning the site, I realized it could also serve as a space to practice and document what I
                        know.</p>
                    <p>I have countless notes, summaries, and spreadsheets—but they're not always accessible, especially when I'm traveling.
                        This website brings it all together in one organized, practical place—now accessible to both me and you, wherever we
                        are.</p>
                    <p>It also serves as a professional portfolio. My career path is not easy to explain, as I've explored many fields and
                        interests over the years. What started as a simple HTML page evolved into a more robust project.</p>
                    <p>I made a deliberate choice not to use frameworks, ChatGPT, or any other shortcuts. I wanted to code everything by
                        hand, to truly face the challenges of building a website and grow from the experience. Everything was going
                        well, until I reached the design phase.</p>
                    <p>I couldn't find a design that satisfied me. I browsed countless websites, looking for inspiration. One day, while
                        struggling with a CSS card design, I asked ChatGPT for help with a warm color scheme. It responded with a suggestion
                        titled "My Site in Red", and that's how this site got its name.</p>
                    <p>At first, I'm going to build it in the simplest way possible kind of like a rough draft, nothing fancy. I think it's counterproductive to start off using advanced tools and technologies. I want to experiment a lot, see what works, what I like best. But down the line, I do plan to give it a more professional structure.</p>
                    <p>Actually, I've already started doing that, you can check it out on my GitHub. I'm writing the frontend with React and Node, and the backend with Spring Boot and MySQL. But the full implementation will come a bit later.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for reading all the way through. I hope this site is useful to you in some way.</p>
